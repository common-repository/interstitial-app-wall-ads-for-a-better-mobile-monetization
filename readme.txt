If you have many regular visitors who frequently revisit your blog, the randomization will likely catch their attention. We have collected a few Adsense tips and information. See below some AdSense tips that will increase your Adsnese revenue, by optimising your Adsense ads.

-AdSense Tip 1: Finding the best keywords-
Start by checking the keyword density that people are looking for when searching on Google. After you have chosen some keywords, you can focus your content with it.

-AdSense Tip 2: Improve the keywords-
Get keyword suggestions from Google AdWords Sandbox, for improving your Adsense ads relevance.

-AdSense Tip 3: Keep your website focused on a theme-
Use the keyword suggestions to enhance your web pages and to build theme-based content. And also try to get your keywords into the anchor text of your incoming links as much as possible. Don't forget that Google AdSense is keyword-targeted advertising: Google AdSense bases its advert topics on your websites content, this means that content-rich websites of a popular topic should attract a large amount of ads.

-AdSense Tip 3: Publish new content every day-
A lot of new content will help to get more visitors. Put an Adsense unit on each and every content page of your site.
AdSense Tip4: Choose the correct AdSense format
Wider formats are more successful because the ads are easier to read, the best AdSense formats are:
1. 336x280 large rectangle
2. 300x250 medium rectangle
3. 160x600 wide skyscraper

-AdSense Tip 6: Position tips-
Visitors tend to look at the big headlines to see if your page is worth reading. If you get them interested, they will read the text and look for your navigation links.
Place the AdSense ads in a prominent place around the top/left part of your page or under your headlines, where your visitors are most likely to look at.
If you have an article page with a long body of text, the bottom of that article is a good place for AdSense ads because your visitors read the text and then they want more resources.

-AdSense Tip 7: Adsense Ads Color-
When creating your Google AdSense ads try to use a color scheme which is similiar to your website's one. Adsense Ads without background color and borders will do  better than Adsense ads within borders with background color.

-AdSense Tip 8: Increase the number of Adsense ads, up to the limit...-
If it is about a page with a lot of text try use multiple AdSense units. You can use up to three AdSense units per page, two AdSense search boxes and one unit of ad links.
AdSense for Search allows visitors to search Google.com and you will get your share from Adsense whenever they click on the ads that come up on the search results.

-AdSense Tip 9: don't do with Adsense Ads!-
* Don't click on your own ads, or ask others to do so.
* Don't place Google ads on sites that include prohibited content (like for example: adult sites)
* Don't use AdSense ads on the same page with other than Adsense ads (like: Yahoo Publisher Network)

= What Is AdSense? =
AdSense is an advertising network operated by Google. Advertisers use AdSense by effectively ask Google to serve their ads on websites that meet certain criteria. Publishers use AdSense by asking Google to show ads on their site that meet certain criteria. AdSense matches up advertisers and publishers, and as a result visitors to many sites out there see Adsense ads when they arrive on a site.
For displaying Adsense ads Google uses its Internet search technology to serve advertisements based on website content, the user's geographical location, and other factors. AdSense has become so popular, because the advertisements are less intrusive and the content of the advertisements is often relevant to the website.
Many websites use AdSense to monetize their content; AdSense has been particularly important for delivering advertising revenue to small websites that do not have the resources for developing advertising sales programs and sales people to generate revenue with. AdSense publishers may only place three ad units per page.

= So why is Adsense so important for small publishers? =
Many publishers, don't have the scale to satisfy larger advertisers. It's much easier to sign a deal with AdSense that lets them buy millions impressions over a number of different sites.
The publishers also save time as well; instead of investing time and money in sales, they can apply for admission to AdSense and with very small work be up and running. So AdSense lets them achieve immediate scale and visibility.
The source of all AdSense income is the AdWords program, which in turn has a pricing model based on a price auction. Google currently shares 68% of revenue generated by AdSense with content network partners, and 51% of revenue generated by AdSense with AdSense for Search partners.

= Adsense types =

- AdSense for Content =
The content-based Adsense ads can be targeted for its context. The targeting can be CPC (click) or CPM (impression) based. CPC Adsense ads are more common. There are various Adsense ad sizes for available for content ads. The adsense ads can be simple text, image, animated image, flash, video, or rich media ads. For most adsense ad sizes, users can change whether to show both text and multimedia ads or just one of them. As of November 2012, a grey arrow appears beneath AdSense text ads for easier identification.

- AdSense for Feeds -
AdSense for Feeds is a version of AdSense that runs on RSS and Atom feeds that have more than 100 active subscribers. AdSense for Feeds works by inserting images into a feed. When the image is displayed by a RSS reader or Web browser, Google writes the adsense advertising content into the image that it returns. The adsense advertisement content is chosen based on the content of the feed surrounding the image. When the user clicks the image, he or she is redirected to the advertiser's website in the same way as regular AdSense advertisements. AdSense for Feeds became available to all AdSense users.

- AdSense for search -
AdSense for search, allows website owners to place Google Custom Search boxes on their websites. When a user searches the Internet or the website with the search box, he may see adsense ads and Google shares 51% of the advertising revenue it makes from those searches with the website owner. However the publisher is getting paid only if the adsense ads on the page are clicked; AdSense does not pay publishers for regular searches.

- AdSense for domains -
AdSense for domains allows adsense ads to be displayed on domain names that have not been developed into an operational website. This adsense offers domain name owners a way to monetize domain names that are otherwise dormant or not in use. AdSense for domains is currently being offered to all AdSense publishers.

- AdSense for video -
AdSense for video allows publishers with video content to generate revenue using adsense ad placements from Google's network including YouTube videos.]
AdSense for Content & AdSense for mobile content

The content-based adverts can be targeted for interest or context. The targeting can be CPC (click) or CPM (impression) based. As of November 2012, a grey arrow appears beneath AdSense text ads for easier identification.
AdSense for mobile content allows publishers to generate earnings from their mobile websites using targeted Google advertisements. Just like AdSense for content, Google matches advertisements to the content of a website — in this case, a mobile website.Instead of traditional JavaScript code, technologies such as PHP, ASP and others are used.

- Getting approved -
In order to start generating revenue through AdSense, you'll first need to get approved. To start that process you'll need a Google account and a website to submit for approval. If your site complies with the standards Google terms you shouldn't have any issues getting approved.

- How much do I earn -
AdSense makes money for Google because the earnings generated are split between network and publisher. You can expect to get around 70% of earnings generated from content ads and 50% of earnings from ads shown on search results.
When do I get paid: AdSense earnings are generally paid out within a month of being earned, either via check or direct deposit.

- Best practise -
Once your AdSense account is running, there are a number of "best practices" for maximizing earnings. First, here's what NOT to do if you decide to use Google AdSense as a way to monetize your traffic:
There's a strict limit in place on the number of ad units you're able to show on each page. Don't include more than three ad units, three link units, and two search boxes per page.
Don't click your own Adsense ads. Clicking on your own ads–which is effectively trying to steal from advertisers appearing on your site–might be the best way to get banned from AdSense.
Don't use deceptive ways to drive Adsense clicks. For example, don't place the Adsesne ads under a heading that reads "Features". so, don't be deceptive in your placements, and you'll be OK in the eyes of AdSense.
Experiment the Adsesne ads with different layouts and implementations.

= How AdSense works =

* The webmaster inserts the AdSense JavaScript code into a webpage.
* Each time this page is visited, the JavaScript code uses the inlined JSON to display content fetched from Google's Adsense servers.
* For contextual advertisements, Adsense Ads are served for those keywords based on the AdWords bidding system.
* For site-targeted Google Adsense ads, the advertiser chooses the page(s) on which to display advertisements, and pays based on (CPM).
* Because the JavaScript for the Adsense ads is sent to the Web browser when the page is requested, it is possible for other website owners to copy the JavaScript code into their own webpages. To protect against this type of fraud, AdSense customers can specify the pages on which advertisements should be displayed. AdSense then ignores clicks from pages other than those specified.
